# How to use VITS

I provide a ready-to-use VITS model trained with UnityChan Audio DataSet produced by Unity Japan, you can easily use it in Next Gen Dialogue by launching a local VITS inference server and config its address in ``AITurboSetting``.

I recommand using this repo [VITS Simple API](https://github.com/Artrajz/vits-simple-api) to launcher server, quite easy.

### Notice

1. This model is prohibited for commercial use.

2. Language supported is Japanese(ja) and Chinese(zh), and Japanese is better. You can set ``VITS Lanaguage`` in ``AITurboSetting`` to translate your dialogue language to VITS supported language.
